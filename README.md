# Matrix-Calculator
This Project is used to calculate the Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication,Transpose,power,determinant,multiplicative inverse of 100*100 matrix <br />
Level 1:<br />
  User must enter a matrix in the form of string like that:<br />
    if he wants to enter 3*3 matrix from 1 to 9 it must be on this form:[1 2 3;4 5 6;7 8 9]<br />
  The Program must parse this string and convert it to int and put each number on array<br />
  This Level can add , subtract , multiply matrices until 100*100<br />
Level 2:<br />
  This Level is used to add , subtract , multiply matrices of conjugate numbers like: 3-4i -3-4i -3+4i 3+4i<br />
Level 3:<br />
  This Level is used on only one Matrix to find it's:<br />
  1-Transpose<br />
  2-Power<br />
  3-Determinant<br />
  4-Division<br />
  5-Multiplicative inverse<br />
