# Matrix-Calculator
This Project is used to calculate the Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication,Transpose,power,determinant,multiplicative inverse of 100*100 matrix
Level 1:
  User must enter a matrix in the form of string like that:
    if he wants to enter 3*3 matrix from 1 to 9 it must be on this form:[1 2 3;4 5 6;7 8 9]
  The Program must parse this string and convert it to int and put each number on array
  This Level can add , subtract , multiply matrices until 100*100
  
Level 2:
  This Level is used to add , subtract , multiply matrices of conjugate numbers like: 3-4i -3-4i -3+4i 3+4i
Level 3:
  This Level is used on only one Matrix to find it's:
  1-Transpose
  2-Power
  3-Determinant
  4-Division
  5-Multiplicative inverse
